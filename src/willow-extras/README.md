# Willow Extras

Themes are stored in `~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/`. This folder contains alternative versions of assets. Copy them to the right location in the theme's folder and reapply the theme for it to update.

## menubaritem.svgz

This provides the menubar appearance when using the `Global Menu` plasmoid. You can get it by creating a new empty panel. Add the `Global Menu` widget and reopen any apps you had. The menubar should disappear from your app and show inside the panel.

- Copy it to `widgets/` inside the theme folder. You probably do not need to copy it to the other directories (e.g.`translucent/widgets`)
